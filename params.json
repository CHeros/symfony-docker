It's an attempt of standardizing and making it easier to bootstrap Symfony applications ready for development and production enviroments. The main tools used are Symfony, Docker and Docker Compose. Other things included are:\r\n\r\n- Supervisord\r\n- Nginx\r\n- MariaDB\r\n- Memcached\r\n- PHP 5.6.17 + PHP-FPM\r\n- Xdebug\r\n- Opcache\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n> Before anything, you need to make sure you have Docker properly setup in your environment. For that, refer to the official documentation for both [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). Also, if you're developing on Mac or Windows – *yeah, maybe that's the case* –, make sure you have [Docker Machine](https://docs.docker.com/machine/) properly setup.\r\n\r\nBuild the containers:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ndocker-compose build\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd run the server:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ndocker-compose up\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter that, all you need to do is install the dependencies:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ndocker-compose run symfony-docker composer --prefer-source install\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnce that's done, you should be able to access the application on the IP that docker (or Docker Machine) is running at.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n","google":"UA-38740172-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
