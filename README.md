Symfony Docker Edition
========================

The *unofficial* Symfony Docker Edition â€“ by [@drgomesp](https://github.com/drgomesp)

This is an unofficial, open-source and community-driven boilerplate for Symfony projects that run on [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). It's an attempt of standardizing and making it easier to bootstrap Symfony applications ready for development and production enviroments. The main tools used are Symfony, Docker and Docker Compose.
